Java distributed spaces

Why? Gelernter described the original vision. 

Why not? Stuff like JCS, memcache, ehcache, hazelcast, river, terracotta, gigaspaces, blitz, java tuplespaces, 
tibco activespaces, infinispan, Jboss cache, and many more are out there, but I find them hard to access,
although hazelcast access is easy.

Sounds like everything is reinventing UNIX filters and forks. Here's another UNIX reinvention.

I want a jar that can do everything everywhere.
