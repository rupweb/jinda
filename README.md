Java distributed spaces

Why? Gelernter described the original vision. 

Why not? Stuff like JCS, memcache, ehcache, hazelcast, river, terracotta, gigaspaces, blitz, java tuplespaces, 
tibco activespaces, infinispan, Jboss cache, and many more are out there, but hard to access.

Sounds like everything is reinventing UNIX filters and forks.

I want a jar that can do everything everywhere.
